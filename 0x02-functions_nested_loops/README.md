PROJECT 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops

Nested loop means a loop statement inside another loop statement. That is why nested loops are also called as â€œloop inside loop"

Note: The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
~ You have to start by creating your `main.h` first.
